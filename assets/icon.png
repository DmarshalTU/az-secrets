# Icon Placeholder

This is a placeholder for the application icon. 

To add a proper icon:

1. Create a 512x512 PNG icon for the application
2. Name it `icon.png` and place it in this directory
3. For macOS, you'll also need an `.icns` file
4. For Windows, you'll need an `.ico` file

You can convert your PNG to these formats using online tools or image editing software.

The icon should represent the application's purpose - managing Azure Key Vault secrets.
