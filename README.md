## Prerequisites

Before running the application, you need to:

1. **Install Azure CLI** (if not already installed):
   ```bash
   # macOS
   brew install azure-cli
   
   # Windows
   winget install Microsoft.AzureCLI
   
   # Linux
   curl -sL https://aka.ms/InstallAzureCLIDeb | sudo bash
   ```

2. **Login to Azure**:
   ```bash
   az login
   ```

3. **Set up permissions**: Ensure your account has access to the Key Vaults you want to manage.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd az-secrets
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the application**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Development

To run the application in development mode with DevTools:

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Building

### For macOS:
```bash
npm run build:mac
```

### For Windows:
```bash
npm run build:win
```

### For Linux:
```bash
npm run build:linux
```

## Usage

1. **Launch the application** - The app will start with a welcome screen
2. **Select a subscription** - Click on a subscription in the sidebar to load its Key Vaults
3. **Choose a Key Vault** - Select a Key Vault to view its secrets
4. **Search secrets** - Use the search bar to find specific secrets using fuzzy search
5. **Manage secrets** - Copy values, toggle visibility, or delete secrets as needed

### Search Features

The fuzzy search works by:
- Matching characters in sequence (e.g., "db" matches "database-connection-string")
- Searching both secret names and values
- Case-insensitive matching
- Real-time filtering as you type

### Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl/Cmd + F`: Focus search input
- `Escape`: Clear search
- `Ctrl/Cmd + C`: Copy selected secret value

## Configuration

The application stores your preferences locally using `electron-store`. Data is stored in:
- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/az-secrets/`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\az-secrets\`
- **Linux**: `~/.config/az-secrets/`

## Security

- All Azure operations use the official Azure SDK
- Authentication is handled through Azure CLI or managed identity
- Secret values are hidden by default and can be toggled
- No secrets are stored locally - they're fetched on-demand

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Failed to load subscriptions"**
   - Ensure you're logged in to Azure CLI: `az login`
   - Check your Azure account permissions

2. **"Failed to load Key Vaults"**
   - Verify your account has access to the subscription
   - Check if the subscription has any Key Vaults

3. **"Failed to load secrets"**
   - Ensure your account has Key Vault access policies configured
   - Check if the Key Vault has any secrets

### Authentication Methods

The application supports multiple authentication methods:
- Azure CLI authentication (recommended)
- Managed Identity (for Azure-hosted environments)
- Service Principal authentication
