# Azure Key Vault Secrets Explorer

A modern, high-performance desktop application for searching and managing Azure Key Vault secrets and keys. Built with Electron and optimized for handling large-scale Azure environments with 100+ Key Vaults.

## üöÄ Performance Optimizations

This application has been specifically optimized to handle large numbers of Azure Key Vaults efficiently:

### Key Performance Improvements

1. **Lazy Loading**: Key Vaults are loaded on-demand rather than all at once
2. **Pagination**: Key Vaults are displayed in pages of 20 to prevent UI freezing
3. **Background Loading**: Data is loaded in the background without blocking the UI
4. **Caching**: Search results and vault data are cached for faster subsequent access
5. **Parallel Processing**: Multiple vaults are loaded simultaneously using Promise.all()
6. **Memory Management**: Automatic cleanup of old cache entries and search results
7. **Debounced Search**: Global search is debounced to prevent excessive API calls
8. **Batch Loading**: When searching all vaults, they're loaded in batches of 3 to avoid overwhelming the API

### Performance Metrics

The application includes real-time performance monitoring:

* Vault loading time tracking
* Search performance metrics
* Memory usage monitoring
* Cache hit rates
* Total items loaded

### Scalability Features

* **100+ Key Vaults**: Tested and optimized for environments with 100+ Key Vaults
* **1000+ Secrets/Keys**: Efficiently handles thousands of secrets and keys
* **Real-time Search**: Fast fuzzy search across all loaded data
* **Progressive Loading**: UI remains responsive while loading large datasets

## Features

## Performance Tips

### For Large Environments (100+ Key Vaults)

1. **Use Pagination**: Navigate through vaults using the pagination controls
2. **Search First**: Use global search to find specific items before loading all vaults
3. **Monitor Performance**: Watch the performance indicator in the bottom-left corner
4. **Clear Cache**: Restart the app periodically to clear accumulated cache

### For High-Security Environments

1. **Disable Value Display**: Use the export feature with "Exclude Values" option
2. **Audit Trail**: Monitor the console for access logs
3. **Regular Cleanup**: Clear search cache regularly to remove sensitive data from memory

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**App becomes unresponsive with many vaults**
- Use pagination to browse vaults in smaller groups
- Use search to find specific items instead of loading all vaults
- Restart the app to clear memory cache

**Slow search performance**
- Ensure you're searching in loaded vaults first
- Use more specific search terms
- Clear search cache if it becomes too large

**Authentication errors**
- Verify Azure CLI is installed and you're logged in
- Check your Azure subscription permissions
- Ensure you have access to the Key Vaults you're trying to view

**Memory usage issues**
- The app automatically manages memory, but you can restart to clear cache
- Monitor the performance indicator for memory usage
- Use the search feature instead of loading all vaults at once

**Build issues**
- Check the [BUILD.md](BUILD.md) file for detailed build instructions
- Ensure all prerequisites are installed
- Try cleaning and rebuilding: `npm run build -- --clean`

## Development

### Building

```bash
# Build for current platform
npm run build

# Build for specific platforms
npm run build:mac
npm run build:win
npm run build:linux
```

### Performance Testing

The application includes built-in performance monitoring:

* Check the console for detailed performance logs
* Monitor the performance indicator in the UI
* Use browser DevTools to analyze memory usage

## Security Considerations

* **Local Storage**: Secret values are stored in memory only, not persisted to disk
* **Authentication**: Uses Azure's DefaultAzureCredential for secure authentication
* **Network**: All communication uses HTTPS with Azure's secure endpoints
* **Memory**: Sensitive data is cleared from memory when possible
